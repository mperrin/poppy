Fresnel Propagation
===========================

POPPY now includes support for Fresnel propagation as well as Fraunhofer.
Particular credit is due to `Ewan Douglas <http://blogs.bu.edu/douglase/>`_ for
initially developing this code.  This substantial upgrade to ``poppy`` enables
calculation of wavefronts propagated arbitrary distances in free space, for applications
such as Gaussian beam propagation and modeling of Talbot effect mixing between phase and
amplitude aberrations.


.. caution::
        The Fresnel code has
        been cross-checked against the `PROPER library by John Krist
        <http://proper-library.sourceforge.net>`_ to verify accuracy and correctness of
        output. A test suite is provided along with ``poppy`` in the tests subdirectory
        and users are encouraged to run these tests themselves.



Usage of the Fresnel code
--------------------------------


The API has been kept as similar as possible to the original Fraunhofer mode of
poppy. There are :class:`~poppy.FresnelWavefront` and :class:`~poppy.FresnelOpticalSystem` classes, which can
be used for the most part similar to the :class:`~poppy.Wavefront` and :class:`~poppy.OpticalSystem` classes.

Users are encouraged to consult the Jupyter notebook `Fresnel_Propagation_Demo
<https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy/blob/master/notebooks/Fresnel_Propagation_Demo.ipynb>`_
for examples of how to use the Fresnel code.

Key Differences from Fraunhofer mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Fresnel propagation API necessarily differs in several ways from the original Fraunhofer API in poppy. Let's highlight a few of the key differences.
First, when we define a Fresnel wavefront, the first argument specifies the desired diameter of the wavefront, and must be given as an `astropy.Quantity <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`_ of dimension length::

        import astropy.units as u
        wf_fresnel = poppy.FresnelWavefront(0.5*u.m,wavelength=2200e-9,npix=npix,oversample=4)
        # versus:
        wf_fraunhofer = poppy.Wavefront(diam=0.5, wavelength=2200e-9,npix=npix,oversample=4)

The Fresnel code relies on the Quantity framework to enforce consistent units and dimensionality. You can use any desired unit of length, from nanometers to parsecs and beyond, and the code will convert units appropriately.
This also shows up when requesting an optical propagation. Rather than having implicit transformations between pupil and image planes, for Fresnel propagation a specific distance must be given. This too is a Quantity giving a length. ::

        wf.propagate_fresnel(5*u.km)


The parameters of a Gaussian beam may be modified (making it converging or
diverging) by adding optical power. In poppy this is represented with the
``QuadraticLens`` class. This is so named because it applies a purely quadratic
phase term, i.e. representative of a parabolic mirror or a lens considered in
the paraxial approximation.  Right now, only the Fresnel ``QuadraticLens`` class
will actually cause the Gaussian beam parameters to change. You won't get that
effect by adding wavefront error with some other ``OpticalElement`` class.

Using the FreselOpticalSystem class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just like the :class:`~poppy.OpticalSystem` serves as a high-level container for
:class:`~poppy.OpticalElement` instances in Fraunhofer propagation, the :class:`~poppy.FresnelOpticalSystem`
serves the same purpose in Fresnel propagation.  Note that when adding an
:class:`~poppy.OpticalElement` to the :class:`~poppy.FresnelOpticalSystem`, you use the function  :meth:`~poppy.FresnelOpticalSystem.add_optic`
and must specify a physical distance separating that optic from the
previous optic, again as an `astropy.Quantity
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`_ of dimension length. This replaces
the ``add_image`` and ``add_pupil`` methods used in Fraunhofer propagation.  For example::


    osys = poppy.FresnelOpticalSystem(pupil_diameter = 0.05*u.m, npix = npix, beam_ratio = 0.25)
    osys.add_optic(poppy.CircularAperture(radius=0.025) )
    osys.add_optic(poppy.ScalarTransmission(), distance = 10*u.m )


If you want the output from a Fresnel calculation to have a particular pixel
sampling, you may either (1) adjust the ``npix`` and ``oversample`` or
``beam_ratio`` parameters so that the propagation output naturally has the
desired sampling, or (2) add a :class:`~poppy.Detector` instance as the *last* optical plane
to define the desired sampling, in which case the output wavefront will be
interpolated onto the desired sampling and number of pixels. Note that when
specifying Detectors in a Fresnel system you must use physical sizes of pixels,
e.g. ``10*u.micron/u.pixel``, and NOT angular sizes in arcsec/pixel like in a
regular Fraunhofer OpticalSystem. For instance::

    osys.add_detector(pixelscale=20*u.micron/u.pixel, fov_pixels=512)

.. admonition:: A non-astronomical example

    A worked example of a compound microscope in POPPY is available

    reproducing the microscope example case provided in the PROPER manual.

Fresnel calculations with Physical units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A subclass, `PhysicalFresnelWavefront`, enables calculations using wavefronts
scaled to physical units, i.e. volts/meter for electric field and watts for
total intensity (power).  This code was developed and contributed by `Phillip
Springer <https://github.com/DaPhil>`_.

See `this notebook
