Documentation for POPPY
=========================

POPPY (Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon) simulates physical optical
propagation including diffraction.  It implements a flexible framework for
modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point
spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical
telescopes.  POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for `JWST
<http://www.stsci.edu/jwst>`_, but is broadly applicable to many kinds of
imaging simulations.

Summary
------------


**What this software does:**

* Allows users to define an optical system consisting of multiple planes, such as pupils and images.
* Provides flexible and extensible optical element classes, including a wide variety of stops, masks, lenses and more.
* Propagates wavefronts between planes using either the :ref:`Fraunhofer <fraunhofer>` or :ref:`Fresnel <fresnel>` approximations of scalar electromagnetic theory.
* Computes monochromatic and polychromatic point spread functions through those optics.
* Provides an extensible framework for defining models of optical instruments, including
  selection of broad- and narrow-band filters, selectable optical components such as pupil stops, models of 
  optical aberrations defined by Zernike polynomials, etc.


**What this software does not do:**

* Full Rayleigh-Sommerfeld electromagnetic propagation.
* Vector electromagnetic field propagation such as would be needed for modeling polarization effects.
* Modelling of any kind of detector noise or imperfections. 


.. admonition:: Quickstart IPython Notebook

       This documentation is complemented by an `IPython Notebook quickstart tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spacetelescope/poppy/blob/master/notebooks/POPPY_tutorial.ipynb>`_.

       Downloading and running that notebook is a great way to get started using POPPY. The documentation following here provides greater details on the algorithms and API.
